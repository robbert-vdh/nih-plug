    /// [`Plugin::editor()`][crate::prelude::Plugin::editor()], you can then read the parameter
    /// values directly from your [`Params`][crate::prelude::Params] object, and modifying the
    /// values can be done using the functions on the [`ParamSetter`][crate::prelude::ParamSetter].
    /// When you change a parameter value that way it will be broadcasted to the host and also
    /// updated in your [`Params`][crate::prelude::Params] struct.
    ///
    /// This function should return a handle to the editor, which will be dropped when the editor
    /// gets closed. Implement the [`Drop`] trait on the returned handle if you need to explicitly
    /// handle the editor's closing behavior.
    ///
    /// If [`set_scale_factor()`][Self::set_scale_factor()] has been called, then any created
    /// windows should have their sizes multiplied by that factor.

    // TODO: Think of how this would work with the event loop. On Linux the wrapper must provide a
    //       timer using VST3's `IRunLoop` interface, but on Window and macOS the window would
    //       normally register its own timer. Right now we just ignore this because it would
    //       otherwise be basically impossible to have this still be GUI-framework agnostic. Any
    //       callback that deos involve actual GUI operations will still be spooled to the IRunLoop
    //       instance.
    // TODO: This function should return an `Option` instead. Right now window opening failures are
    //       always fatal. This would need to be fixed in baseview first.
