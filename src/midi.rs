    /// - By default, a voice uses the parameter's global value, which may or may not include
    ///   monophonic modulation. This is `parameter.value` for unsmoothed parameters, and smoothed
    ///   parameters should use block smoothing so the smoothed values can be reused by multiple
    ///   voices.
    /// - If a `PolyModulation` event is emitted for the voice, that voice should use the the
    ///   _normalized offset_ contained within the event to compute the voice's modulated value and
    ///   use that in place of the global value.
    ///   - This value can be obtained by calling `param.preview_plain(param.normalized_value() +
    ///     event.normalized_offset)`. These functions automatically clamp the values as necessary.
    ///   - If the parameter uses smoothing, then the parameter's smoother can be copied to the
    ///     voice. [`Smoother::set_target()`][crate::prelude::Smoother::set_target()] can then be
    ///     used to have the smoother use the modulated value.
    ///   - One caveat with smoothing is that copying the smoother like this only works correctly if it last
    ///     produced a value during the sample before the `PolyModulation` event. Otherwise there
    ///     may still be an audible jump in parameter values. A solution for this would be to first
    ///     call the [`Smoother::reset()`][crate::prelude::Smoother::reset()] with the current
    ///     sample's global value before calling `set_target()`.
    ///   - Finally, if the polyphonic modulation happens on the same sample as the `NoteOn` event,
    ///     then the smoothing should not start at the current global value. In this case, `reset()`
    ///     should be called with the voice's modulated value.
    /// - If a `MonoAutomation` event is emitted for a parameter, then the values or target values
    ///   (if the parameter uses smoothing) for all voices must be updated. The normalized value
    ///   from the `MonoAutomation` and the voice's normalized modulation offset must be added and
    ///   converted back to a plain value. This value can be used directly for unsmoothed
    ///   parameters, or passed to `set_target()` for smoothed parameters. The global value will
    ///   have already been updated, so this event only serves as a notification to update
    ///   polyphonic modulation.
